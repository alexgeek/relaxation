# Elementwise solution

allocate array with given dimensions to current and next
for each step:
  for each element:
    el = sum(neighbours)/4
    update e1 on next
  dealloc current
  set current to next


# Divide and Conquer

## Worker Threads

while condvar > 0
  for each element assigned
    complete = true
    do the add
    if complete && precision not met
        complete = false
  wait for other threads to complete
  if complete == false then run_again = true
  wait for other threads to complete

## Main Thread

init barrier to n
create n threads, assigning them the bounds of the array
join all threads



barrier
if threadid == 0 then
  spawn cleanup thread
all wait on semaphore
